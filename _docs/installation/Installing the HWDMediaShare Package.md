The HWDMediaShare Installer Package for Joomla is the main gallery package that includes the core extensions. Installing HWDMediaShare is no different than installing any other Joomla extension on your site.

This documentation is written for Joomla 3, and refers to the HWDMediaShare Installer Package that is compatible with Joomla 3.

### Getting the official installer package

You can obtain the latest release of the HWDMediaShare packages by visiting our Joomla 3 download pages. You will need to login to your account to access the packages.

​Download Installer Package​

Attention Mac OS X users! The Safari browser automatically extracts the ZIP file into a directory and then removes the ZIP file needed for a Joomla!™ install. To install the extension in Joomla!™ you must select that directory, right-click on it, then select "Compress" to yield a ZIP file as required by the Joomla!™ installer.

### Installing the Package
After you have downloaded the package, you must then login to the Joomla Administrator area of your website. To access this area, enter the url in your browser as:

```http://www.yoursite.com/administrator/```

Replace "yoursite.com" with your actual domain name. Enter your Administrator Username and Password, then click the "Login" button to proceed.

Once logged in, move your mouse pointer to the "Extensions" menu item at the top, then click the "Extension Manager" item.

From the Extension Manager, click on the Browse button to locate the installation file downloaded from HWDMediaShare. The file will be called hwdmediashare_installer_3.zip.

After clicking on the Browse button, you will be presented with a local file browser. This window allows you to browse your computer. Locate the hwdmediashare_installer_3.zip file. Click on the zip file to highlight it, then click the "Open" button in the window.

Once selected, click on the Upload & Install button.

You'll also see other options to visit the HWDMediaShare dashboard or run the maintenance. We recommend you run the maintenance each time you install and upgrade HWDMediaShare.

That's it! The HWDMediaShare gallery is now installed on your Joomla website.

You can verify the installation by clicking on the Manage tab of the Joomla Extensions Manager. This displays a list of all the extensions that are installed in your Joomla website. Filter the list to display only packages, and search for "installer". You'll see the HWDMediaShare package, with version number and release date.
