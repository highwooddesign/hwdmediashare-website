VAT stands for value added tax, which is charged on goods and services sold by Highwood Design Limited within the European Union (EU). In accordance with the laws governing members of the European Union, Highwood Design Limited is obliged to charge VAT on all orders delivered to destinations in member countries of the EU.

On the 4th January 2011, the UK government increased the UK standard rate of VAT rate from 17.5% to 20%. For more information, visit the [HM Revenue & Customs](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/forms-rates/rates/rate-increase.htm "VAT Increase") website. Please be aware that from 4th January 2011 this change is now reflected in all new invoices raised.

The VAT number for Highwood Design Limited is **GB 992584761**.

### VAT on Sales by Highwood Design Limited for UK customers

The UK VAT rate is 20.0%. All prices shown on the HWDMediaShare website are exclusive of VAT. If you live in the UK then VAT will be added during checkout.

### VAT on Sales by Highwood Design Limited for EU customers outside the UK

Highwood Design Limited is required by law to collect VAT on orders for goods and services dispatched to most countries within the European Union. On 1 January 2015, the rules around the [European Union (EU) VAT](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-supplying-digital-services-to-private-consumers/vat-businesses-supplying-digital-services-to-private-consumers) changed. Now services will always be taxed in the country where the customer belongs. Therefore, EU customers outside of the UK will be charged [VAT rates from the country where they belong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_of_Europe). All prices shown on the HWDMediaShare website are exclusive of VAT. If you live in the EU then VAT will be added during checkout.

If you provide a valid EU VAT registration number, you are identifying yourself as an EU business. If you're registered outside the UK, VAT will not be applied. This is called a "Reverse Charge". VAT numbers will be validated using the [VIES VAT number validation](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/) system. Please note, we are unable to refund any charges if a VAT number is supplied after an invoice has been generated and paid.

### Customers outside of the EU

Goods sold by Highwood Design Limited that are dispatched to addresses outside of the European Union are not subject to EU VAT.
