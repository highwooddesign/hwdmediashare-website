Our Joomla PHP extensions are open source, and do not require license keys. The usage license never expires, and you can continue to use the software you have downloaded forever. However, our products sometimes offer integrations with third party products or services. **Our subscriptions do not include licenses for any third party services or products. Third party licenses need to be purchased separately directly from the original service provider.**

Examples of these integrations include:
* [JWPlayer](http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/)
* [Flowplayer](https://flowplayer.org/pricing/)
* [Amazon AWS (S3, Cloudfront)](http://aws.amazon.com/pricing/)

We provide integrations with these third party services to:
* Facilitate usage and integration of third party services within the Joomla CMS.
* Provide you with more choice when using the Joomla CMS.

Our subscriptions do not include licenses for any commercial third party services. If payment is required by a third party provider for any service or product then the payment will need to be made directly to that third party provider.
