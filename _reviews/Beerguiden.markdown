Here is something that is really good, a video component that already has the most and have a great future for themselves, not least for us users.

I have the following experience, after I bought their installation service and Pro subscribed.

1. Fast and professional service.
2. Personal and friendly staff.
3. Stable and functional component (although alpha stage).
4. Superb service with installation on my server the necessary software to exploit hwdVideoShare fully, a 100 points.
5. Support forum where there is help around the clock, it seems that, one wonders if they never sleeps!
6. Most importantly, you are guaranteed never left behind out there in the dark without the help and support.

No and again no, I is not bought by Highwood Design, only an incredibly satisfied customer / user.
