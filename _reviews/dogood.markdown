I've operating a constant survey about video components within Joomla for two years. tried about everything listed here, and some others more. What hwdVideoShare does is exactly what I was looking for!

IMO, the component structure deals with coding standards and security, which are my great concerns! While there's a lot of work to do, bugs, translations and features, the way it runs right now, in Alpha release, is very promising for the future. Support is fast and nice, and developers are fast guys too!!

Regarding the subscription cost, it doesn't bother me at all, as I am a partisan of the Bazar rather than the cathedral!! For those who don't want to subscribed, why don't you buy a proprietary software license?
