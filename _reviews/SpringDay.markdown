The LAST step to getting my sites off of Legacy Mode was a video component to replace Seyret.

*****FOUND IT!*****

An unequivocal AMAZING is my take on this component!

Read the good reviews below. This thing was up and running in less than 10 minutes! Options GALORE! Clean and simple default layout! And it does everything as advertised, AND MORE!

My one dread was re-creating everything I had done in Seyret. Really NOT looking forward to setting up all over again. But it has to be done... WAIT A MINUTE... In the "Import" tab they have a Seyret Import. Okay, but I am sure there will be problems...HOLY CRIMANY! It pulled my entire Seyret system over PERFECTLY.
