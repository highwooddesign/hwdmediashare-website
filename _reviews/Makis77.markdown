I was ready to rate it as "Good" but changed my mind since this video component is excellent for the money it costs. Forum support is good even though there is only one guy behind it while at the same time the plugins offered are really interesting. If he manages to make some more changes like having categories and subcategories, easy to use and edit template system and getting a native 1.5 version then this component will be the best without any doubt.
