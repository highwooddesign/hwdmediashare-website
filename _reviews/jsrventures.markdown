Great component. Elegantly designed and works very much out of the box. The administration backend has plenty of useful functions and is clear and easy to use. Installation instructions, including those at the server level are very complete and maintained.

I used it for a commercial site and worked without a glitch. Some in these reviews complain about the fact that updates are not free of charge but price is reasonable for the amount of work behind this component.

Certainly recommended.
