This is without doubt the best video extension out there and I have tried most of them!!! What makes it the best is that it is under active development and the the developer listens to his community and adds features that are requested. There were several features I needed for my project so I posted a few proof-of-concept hacks on the forum. They are now fully integrated features in the core so I can continue to upgrade without worrying! This really is an outstanding example of software organically evolving to fit its users needs. Keep up the great work!
