One of the best video extensions around. It's great to see the developer continuing to support this extension and improve on it. The admin of this extension is very extensive, but is bordering on becoming a little complicated. The best feature I find with this extension is it plays external site videos like youtube, locally uploaded video .flv files and also your .swf flash movies. Only thing is the .swf can push righthand modules out of position. I fixed this by placing the player in a table. Overall it's a fairly easy to run extension out of the box.
