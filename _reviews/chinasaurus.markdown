The hwdVideoShare component is an excellent component, well... Let me just say that a year ago, there was a choice I had to make between the Seyret component or HWDVideo. I had chosen Seyret because at that time it was the better choice... But now I had made the migration to HWD because HWD has vastly improved and I can honestly say it has become the more dominant component. The support is excellent and that has got to count for something and their team of experts are constantly working hard to perfect this component. Although there are some minor bugs and issues, I still have faith in this component. I definitely recommend this component to anyone who wants to add value to their user experience.
