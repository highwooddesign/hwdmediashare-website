I have always struggled with the 'youtube' style website, I've used phpmotion, I've tried seyret and was looking at opting for clipshare not so long ago. I saw HWMediaShare some time ago but was put off by the price, I simply couldn't afford it at the time, but now the price has come down and the component itself is free to use. I was overwhelmed by its flexibility, tools and features. Its integrations are great and growing continually. The support is quick and good, and the documentation is the best available, especially for installing ffmpeg and mencoder. The pro license is great value, plus you get the modules and plugins which are really useful.
