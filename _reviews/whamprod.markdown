We had some difficulty with installation, partly having to do with our own server settings, and partly having to do with the source code's inability to deal with those settings. When we asked for help, we received it, and they were very prompt in delivering it. We gave them FTP and admin access for diagnostics purposes. They fixed our problem, and more importantly, they rewrote their source code to better handle our type of situation in the future. Our installation now works as advertised. You can't get any better service than that!
