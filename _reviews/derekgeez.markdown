This is a great component. Although still with a few bugs, the developer is rock-solid in their response and offers support I have not found on any other joomla extension. Most times you post something in a forum and hope and pray the developers might get back to you... these guys do and usually within the day, I don't think they ever sleep.

The component has a very clean and easy admin panel, uploading is a snap and looking at the upgrades to come, this one is well worth the investment.
