We needed a component that would allow large video uploads which could then be downloaded by registered users... we achieved this with HWDMediaShare, plus got the added benefit of automatic conversion to .flv so visitors can also view online! Very much worth the small licensing fee, and the support was the best we've seen from any other developer out there, and that's no exaggeration. We had some questions along the way and he answered them very quickly, then we ran into what seemed to be a roadblock and he went the extra mile to fix the issue.
