I was expecting tons of setup and troubleshooting time with this, and nothing of a sort happened. I installed the com and plug-ins and was adding youtube videos 5 minutes later! The template it came with was actually the pefect color match to my site so I was even fine with that. I haven't tried the mencoder/ffmpeg local conversions but I really don't need this for that. The youtube adding function works well enough.
