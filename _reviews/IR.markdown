It is not very often that one comes across an extension that is so well made: does what it is supposed to do, is highly configurable, easy to administer, easy to use on the front end, and looks great. And not to mention, has such a phenomenal level of support. I've had a few issues and after posting on the support forum, the programmer was quick to help troubleshoot and, if necessary, even log in and fix whatever it was. I have never encountered such a level of customer service with any Joomla! plugin-in, component or extension! It is really worth the small fee for this product, I don't know how I lived without it for so long. My sincere kudos, gratitude and appreciation to Davros. All I can say is, "Well done!"
