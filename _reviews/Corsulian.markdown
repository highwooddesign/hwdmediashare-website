I've been cautiously watching the development of hwdvideoshare for months now. Today I went ahead and bought it ($25.28 US...not too bad).

I read the installation guide and forum posts with trepidation: "you'll need to configure servers! and know the ins and outs of Perl!" they all said.

It installed without errors in a minute. I had it stood up and uploaded a video the next minute. I activated the Perl-based uploader a few minutes after that.

It automatically recognized my CB and JComments components.

I'm not on a dedicated server so I lack the fancy tools that REALLY make this a great component. However, my shared server is otherwise configured correctly. I don't get automatic thumbnails or automatic conversions to .flv, but I still think the component is worth it.
