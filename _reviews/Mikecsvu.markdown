I trialled several video solutions while setting up my site and opted for hwdvideoshare not only because it has great options and configurability, but because of the support. Queries are answered and if the developer can, he'll work on a fix for you. It's not perfect but what is? Plus, their willingness to adopt and develop integration with Jomsocial makes this a winner! If you want video on your site, this is the best out there in my opinion.
