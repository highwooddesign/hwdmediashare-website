Brilliant software, amazing quality service and support 5 stars! First off the software itself is very VERY good. It does exactly what it says on the 'box' and a WHOLE LOT more. Turns your site into a Youtube type video site, in fact I found it to actually be better in spec to Youtube. Its highly configurable and the backend is also VERY well set out. We'd had problems with FFMPEG installation on our server but these guys had us up and running in 48 hours. Our site is also a busy community for alternative people and runs Jomsocial. There were quite a few functions missing to truly integrate HWD with Jomsocial. However after a few emails Dave from HWD had written us a Jomsocial hack to fully integrate HWD to the front page of Jomsoacial = AWESOME!
