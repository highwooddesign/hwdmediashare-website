It's true, HWDMediaShare components are still under development and purchasing them wont avoid you to face little bugs with it. Although, I'm rating it 5 stars! Why? because the components are at the point other components are at also, if not more developed especially with the RevenueManager component you get for free (others didn't develop it). If you are scared of the "bugs"...the Highwood media share forum will kill them in 24 hours for you, with personal service and support. What would you ask for more? If not convinced about it, the component is not made for you so simply.
