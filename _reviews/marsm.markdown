An awesome product - a ton of features and excellently priced for what it has to offer. Installation and configuration in Joomla is straightforward, but the back-end support tools (which are required) do require some work and knowledge. HWD do, however, offer this as an add-on service which I availed of and was extremely happy with - they are an exceptionally professional company, and their support is top drawer. They answer queries promptly and professionally and actually try to help you. In closing, this component is highly recommend, and you're getting great value for money. Five stars!
