I discovered this extension by accident during my Christmas break and thought that it might be fun to try it out and see if it could be used on a site for teachers (as I work in education). At that point, I had no experience of installing / using Joomla at all. Over the space of a few days, I had Joomla up and running and this extension installed. The process was pretty straightforward (even with my limited experience) and the site I developed is now in active use by hundreds of teachers each day. The extension is fantastic and although I'm not using everything that it can do, it's been a wonderful tool which is easy to manage and is extremely powerful. The support from their forums is fantastic too - highly recommended!
