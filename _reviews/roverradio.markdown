Been using this component almost from day 1 of its existence, and have contributed quite a bit of feedback on their site. Response from developer is good, and development is pretty active.

Feature requests generally make it in, and bug fixes are usually pretty quick. The feature set has gotten more robust as development had continued, and I expect it to get even better.

Not only did I donate for the Pro version, I've made a few EXTRA donations just because it's such a useful piece of software!
