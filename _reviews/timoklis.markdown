As I was trying to make a video gallery for my website, I did a very good research for the best way to do that. Highwood Design Video Share is the best I found and I'm already using it. It lets your users to upload or "embed" their favorite videos, so you don't have to do anything. It has many many parameters to suit everyone's needs but it is easy to install, easy to get the idea about how it works and easy to configure. The support also seems to be great and fast. With your subscription you get the all-in-one package (component, modules, templates, plugins...) so you don't have to search and download every extra thing that you need. For the money you give, you get many many good stuff! well done guys, keep up the good job!
