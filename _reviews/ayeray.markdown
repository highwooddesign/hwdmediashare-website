This is a very excellent component. I downloaded it with the intention to place a video gallery on my website solely with youtube videos, but with the occasional hosted video. I like the ability to place youtube videos in a custom player and the option to choose said player. It was also very easy to edit the buttons to a different color using MS paint. It is thoroughly configurable and is very easy to configure parameters and access control on any scale. I was not able to test the uploading feature, as my server doesn't support conversions.
