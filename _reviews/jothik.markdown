One word sums it all up. It has all basic function to kick start. I tried Seyret Video Component first but cant make it to work. Tried free one impressed and upgraded to PRO version. Basic is good, but it would need a lot work to include more features. For now this is the best one out there.

Hoping that developers will improve and provide more enhanced versions with more options.
