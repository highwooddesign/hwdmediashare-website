Simply one of the best extensions in Joomla, and the best bar none to create a Joomla video gallery. I've used hwdVideoShare and its little brother hwdPhotoShare in more that ten sites and could not be happier. I also run some several big non-Joomla video sites so I know what I'm talking about.

I evaluated other video galleries for Joomla in the past and I regret not going for hwdVideoShare in the first place, as alternatives only proved to be pricey time wasters.

Not being able to post in the forum piss me off a bit, but when I bumped into any issue during my first steps I contacted the developers and they gave me a response within 24 hours, which is remarkable.

If I had to say something negative about the component is that the default template don't look sexy enough with my favourite Joomla templates. If the design was fancier I would rate it as 6 stars.

I bet that webmasters who have published harsh reviews in JED about this extension don't really understand what FREE is (this extension is both free as both free and open source), and never took the time to check if their server met the minimum requirements to run a video gallery or even read the documentation.

Kudos to the hwdVideoShare team for this great component!
