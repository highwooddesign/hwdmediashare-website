This is a great component, the results are amazing with very little effort. I did have some bumps setting up the path to some directories, I have windows server and every time I tried to enter the paths on the server settings, it would save the path with strange characters, I had to modify the configuration fields and set the variable manually, but the developers did warn about being in the beta stage. This is a minor issue, comparing the nice outcome.
