This really is a very good product. It's really simple to upload videos and display them nicely categorized, complete with a description, title and length of the movie. In addition, they have great support. Even if you're using the free component (which really is 100% free, don't know where the review before me got the idea that it isn't) you get support. I know, because I needed some help and emailed them. A ticket was made and within 48 hours my problem was solved. The free version does show the logo of the makers below the video, but it's not disturbing at all in my opinion and for a component like this, I think you're entitled to show your logo if you're handing it out for free.
