No doubts I'll give 5 stars to hwdVideoShare component. Easy to setup - many video formats (mpg, mpeg, avi, divx, mp4, flv, wmv, rm, mov, moov, asf, swf and vob) - ajax upload system (even with the FREE edition!!!) - personal FLV player for uploaded videos! Yes! You can use your own personal FLV player Awesome! - Integrates like a charm with CB, JomComment and Adsense - templates use plugin system! great idea! - developer is open to suggestions and he REALLY gives support!!

Upcoming release will also feature members' playlists and XML support! Wow! Just W O W!!

Being a pro-member to many Joomla components I assure you'll get REAL and FREE support @ highwood design forums! And considering the support is also for FREE members, well...what you're waiting for? Grab this component and start playing with it, now!

Oh...did I mention the PRO version costs ONLY 22$/year?! Dudes, are you serious?! ONLY 22$/years!? It's a bargain! GET it NOW!!
