Well, not ALL went smoothly. the installation did. the component worked perfectly. but hoo no! the titles were a little buggy because i use Hebrew letters. well, support simply took my hwd and user name, logged in, found the bug and squashed it well... like a bug :). friendliest support i had ever seen :). I would probably use it even with the trimmed titles bug but hey, now its even better... :D. 5 stars. and big thanks.
