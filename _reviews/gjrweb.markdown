The com is really superb. Within a week a realized a complete video channel for my website. Low costs, no ads (with commercial JW player license), great to implement and a nice admin area. The com comes with all the basic features you need together with lot's of modules and plugins (language, 3rd party compatibility etc). Integration into our template went smooth. Unfortunately the design is not tableless. Support it fast and efficient via a ticket system. I also have the idea development is working hard on improvements and new versions. Overall I certainly would advice this com to others. It's maybe the best there is for a Joomla! video channel...
