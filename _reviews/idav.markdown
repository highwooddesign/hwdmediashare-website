Installed easily on Joomla 1.7 and was easy to implement. Other video extensions I tried didn't have the features found in hwdVideoShare. There is great documentation for helping with setup and for things needed on the hosting server. I did have one minor issue with a couple of buttons which turned out to be a conflict with my Joomla template, but there is great support which helped resolve the issue. The component does what it says.
