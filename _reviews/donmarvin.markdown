You can have a YouTube-like site up and running in a matter of minutes in a shared hosting environment. I first tried the free version and used a webhosts recommended by the developer. I've been very happy with my webhost for many years and was reluctant to use one unknown to me, but my webhost does not have FFMPEG installed on shared hosting accounts. The one I ended up using not only has everything needed to run this component but also has a php upload limit of 500MB and excellent support as well. Enough about the webhost, the component is awesome. It worked right out of the box and any questions or glitches I had were answered promptly via the forum. I was very pleasantly surprised. I wanted to make some customizations to the layout and found modifying the code to be easy enough. This is fantastic for a free component and the Pro version was only US$32. Quite a value! Thank you!
