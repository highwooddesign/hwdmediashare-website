I must say that this extension is absolutely amazing and works as described.
I did have some minor questions that got resolved in the forums.
I upgraded to the Pro version myself. The developers are constantly in the forums answering anyone's questions about this, so it's well worth it. All documentation about installing the required stuff for converting are easy to understand and it's all written in great detail where even a NOOB Linux/CentOS user like myself can understand it. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to put videos on their site!
Well done to the development team for creating such an awesome component and well organized community on your site for assistance!
