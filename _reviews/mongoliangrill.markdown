Kudos to the HWD team; A splendid job is what I call it! I have been building this community site for my customer and had a new requirement to build a media sharing portal. I tried several open source options and failed to get what I wanted. I was hesitant in using HWD, but once I installed it and started using it, I loved it. Trust me it had a lot more feature than I expected and it works like a charm. I had a couple of trivial issues, but their support team is just instrumental in what they do. They logged into my account, set things straight. If you are looking for a good component for media sharing, try HWD you WILL be pleased.
