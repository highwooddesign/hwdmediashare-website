I was first not sure which video component to get for our church website. I was stuck between both Seyret Video and hwdMediaShare. But after reading the reviews it seemed that hwdMediaShare came out on top.

Not only because of the native 1.5 integration into the site, but the "special ads" Seyret was trying to hock didn't sit to well with me.

Now, after I installed hwdMediaShare on our site, I had some problems. But I left a message on the boards about it an within hours Davros said he would take care of it and it works amazing!

So with the component, the subscription and the hands on service hwdMediaShare wins without a doubt.
