For a change a extensions developer who listens to what the users want and develops accordingly, especially Davros is simply amazing... the pricing is also top of the line this component can well be priced at over $75 and still would have takers but its just $30 for 5 site license which is unbelievable considering what the component does and also how helpful these guys are.
