This extension is by far the best in its category!!! I've tried Seyret among others for months but only now I got THE video extension. Very feature rich, very easy to install and setup.

It does have some bugs, but the developers are VERY helpful!!! And the product is under a continuous improvement, they DO listen to the customers feedback and are always including bug fixes and new features in the new releases.

I recommend it!
