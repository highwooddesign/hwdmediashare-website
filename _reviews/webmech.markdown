I was well pleased with this extension, Its easy to install, an endless amount of customizations, does a lot/most of the work for you if you are putting together a media/voter based website. This was well worth the pro version. I mean it is great, and good customer support too. You will need system level access to the server if you wish to stream videos directly from the website, otherwise you can still use videos hosted elsewhere. Helped me beat a deadline for one of my clients by weeks. This is basically a turnkey solution to any common video/community website. Works awesome with CB too! I give credit where its due, its pretty friggin awesome.
